	% Generating list permutations. Proably this is the shortest possible representation of alorithm 
	% for generating list permutations for universal programming languages. 
	% Run this program using the option for finding all decisions.

	% Goal:
permutation of list ( {1} {2} {3} {4} ) is list [W]..

	% Program:
permutation of list A {M} B is list [{M}W] :- permutation of list A B is list [W]..
permutation of list ( ) is list [ ]..
