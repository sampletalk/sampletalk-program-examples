	% Grammar and logic patterns

translation of [A, and B] is 	X  and  Y :- 	translation of [A] is X,,	translation of [B] is Y..
translation of [A, while B] is 	X  and  Y :- 	translation of [A] is X,,	translation of [B] is Y..
translation of [if A, B] is 	not (X)  or  Y :-	translation of [A] is X,,	translation of [B] is Y..
translation of [since A, B] is 	not (X)  or  Y :-	translation of [A] is X,,	translation of [B] is Y..
translation of [when A, B] is 	not (X)  or  Y :-	translation of [A] is X,,	translation of [B] is Y..
translation of [X is Y] is	Y(X) :-		Y is 1-arity predicate,,	X is object..
translation of [X V Y] is 	V (X , Y) :-	V is 2-arity verb,, Y is object,,	X is object..

	% Fuzzy logic calculus patterns
translation of [X is C Y] is 	C (Y , X) :-	C is fuzzy qualifier,, Y is 1-arity predicate,, X is object..
translation of [X is C Y] is 	C (Y , X) :-	C is fuzzy 2-arity predicate,, X is object,, Y is object..

	% Handling unrecignizable words and phrases:
translation of [A] is [unknown object]..

pink 		is 	1-arity predicate..
yellow 		is 	1-arity predicate..

intersect 		is 	2-arity verb..

border 		is 	object..
tissue area	is 	object..
white strips	is 	object..
stain		is 	object..
blot		is 	object..
blur		is 	object..
blutch		is 	object..
conductor	is 	object..
brim		is 	object..


fairly 		is 	fuzzy qualifier..
not enough	is 	fuzzy qualifier..
somewhat	is 	fuzzy qualifier..
almost		is 	fuzzy qualifier..
almost not	is 	fuzzy qualifier..
slightly		is 	fuzzy qualifier..

thick 		is 	fuzzy 1-arity predicate..
near 		is 	fuzzy 2-arity predicate..
