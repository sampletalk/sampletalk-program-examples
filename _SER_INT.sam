%  SER_INT. Musicologic Analisis: Generation of All-Intervale series.
%  This program searches for such permutations of the list of digits
%  1,2,...12 (12 sequential tones of a dodecaphonic series),
%  that the set of (reduced by mod 6) intervales between the adjacent
%  tones is 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6. 
%  Calculation of the intervales is made by Prolog calls.
%  See also the programs PERMUT, SERIES.
