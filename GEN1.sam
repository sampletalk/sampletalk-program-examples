	% Recognition of regularities in word codes.

	% Goal:
words [a 1 2 z b] and [c z 2 1 d] have inversion fragments [X] and [Y]..	

	% Program:
words [A X B] and [C Y D] have inversion fragments [X] and [Y] :- reverse of [X] is [Y]..
reverse of [A M] is [N A]:-reverse of [M] is [N]..
reverse of [A B] is [B A]..

	% See program REVERSE1.SAM for explanation of the last clauses. Try this program with various 
	% compiler options: Find All Decisions, Write Immediate Results (Yes/No), Stop Between Output 
	% Lines etc). English words, introduced just here, work simultaneously as the algorithm elements 
	% and as designations of the corresponding concepts. Concept of "reverse" is comprehensively 
	% defined here.
