% This program forms all permutations of a list of numbers. See also program PERMUT.
% Use SENSITIVE BACKTRACKING and FIND ALL DECISIONS options.

result of permutation of [[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]] is [W]..	% Goal

result of permutation of [A] is [[N],W]:-			% Program
	result of extracting [N] from A is [B],,
	result of permutation of [B] is [W]..
result of permutation of [**] is [ ]..
result of extracting [N] from A[N]B is [A B]..

% Once more: we are PROGRAMMING in a natural language and explain concepts just here, in this short program!
