	% Morphologic and syntax analysis of a sentence. This program takes an English sentence
	% and produces a tree representing grammar analysis of this sentence. The output represents 
	% parsing tree structure along with morphological tags. For developing the morphologic 
	% analysis, see program MORPHOLOGY.SAM.
	% (Here we don't consider problems of ambiguity in NL morphology and parsing)

	% Goal (variable T stands for the parsing tree):
tree for sentence [this large apple is tasty since it has ripened] is T.. 	

	% Rules:
tree for sentence [X] is T:- 
	morphologic tagging for sentence [X] is Y,, 
	tree for tagged sentence [# Y #] is T..

	% Morphologic tagging. Recursive rule:
morphologic tagging for sentence [A X] is T[A] Y :- 
	word A has morphologic tag T,, 
	morphologic tagging for sentence [X] is Y..	    

	% Boundary condition for last 2 words:
morphologic tagging for sentence [A B] is T1[A] T2[B] :- 
	word A has morphologic tag T1,, 
	word B has morphologic tag  T2..

	% Building the tree.	Recursive rule:
tree for tagged sentence [A X B] is W :- 
	grammar rule: T[X] is a grammar pattern ,, 
	tree for tagged sentence [A T[X] B] is W..       
	% Boundary condition:
tree for tagged sentence [# X #] is X ..

	% Gramamar patterns:
grammar rule: 	noun[determiner[_] aj[_] noun[_]] 		is a grammar pattern..	
grammar rule: 	noun[determiner[_] noun[_]] 			is a grammar pattern..		    
grammar rule: 	noun[aj[_] noun[_]] 				is a grammar pattern..		    
grammar rule: 	sent[noun[_] past_verb[_]]		 	is a grammar pattern..		    
grammar rule: 	sent[noun[_] be[_] aj[_]]			is a grammar pattern..		
grammar rule: 	sent[pronoun[_] have_sg[_] past_verb[_]] 	is a grammar pattern..
grammar rule: 	sent[sent[_] logic[_] sent[_]]			is a grammar pattern..
