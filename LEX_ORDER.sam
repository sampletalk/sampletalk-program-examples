	% Testing lexicographic order for words.
	% This program answers "Yes" or "No" after comparing words. 
	% To understand it, conceive symbol ":-" as "if" and remember
	% that variables (here A,B,M,N and _) may match any subwords.

	% Goals (leave uncommented exactly one of them):
[c a t a l o g u e] < [c a t e g o r y]..
%[c a t a l o g u e] < [c a t]..		

	% Program:
letters in order: [# a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z #].. 	
[A M] < [A N] :- [M] < [N]..  
[A _] < [B _] :- letters in order: [_ A _ B _]..
