	Text theory, given in this appendix, is theory of natural 
number lists. The theory includes complete formalization of 
number comparison and classic merge sort algorithm, including 
algorithm for splitting a list into even and odd elements
and algorithm for merging ordered lists. Natural numbers are 
represented as lists of space-separated digits in brackets, e.g. [1 2 8]. 
	Note the following amazing feature of this theory. Although it is 
quite complex, it does not apply any algorithmic concepts besides 
text unification. The theory includes =implicit= definitions of some knowledge  
about words and concepts "has more", "is", "belongs to", "precedes", 
"starts with" "result of" etc. It is already not surprising for us 
that natural-language meaning of these concepts is totally 
consistent with functionality of the theory.

The theory is written in form of Sampletalk program.
Below are some possible inputs for the theory:

1) result of sorting natural number list [[7],[1 2 8],[2],[2],[1 2],[3 4 5]] is natural number list [X]..
2) natural number list [[7],[3],[1 2],[5],[6 6]] consists of even elemens [[X]] and odd elements [[Y]]..
3) result of merging ordered natural number lists [[4],[1 5 5],[2 0 0] and [[2],[1 2],[1 4 5]] is ordered natural number list [X]..
4) [1 2] belongs to list [[2],[7],[1 2],[4]].. 
5) [1 7] belongs to list [[2],[7],[1 2],[4]].. 

Variables X and Y are to be instantiated by the theory. The corresponding 
outputs of the theory are as follows:

1) result of sorting natural number list [[7],[1 2 8],[2],[2],[1 2],[3 4 5]] is natural number list [[2],[2],[7],[1 2],[1 2 8],[3 4 5]]..
2) natural number list [[7],[3],[1 2],[5],[6 6]] consists of even elemens [[3],[5]] and odd elements [[7],[1 2],[6 6]]..
3) result of merging ordered natural number lists [[4],[1 5 5],[2 0 0] and [[2],[1 2],[1 4 5]] is ordered natural number list [[2],[4],[1 2],[1 4 5],[1 5 5],[2 0 0]]..
4) [1 2] belongs to list [[2],[7],[1 2],[4]]..
5) No.

The last input contradicts to the theory, so application of the theory
to this input leads to failure.
