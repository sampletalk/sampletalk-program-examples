	% Dividing a list into two parts: for even and odd elements.
	% These clauses are used in program SORTMERGE.SAM (merge sort).
	% Variables A and B stand for the resulted lists.
	% Characters + and = define syntax for usage of these clauses in the form <list> = <list> + <list>

 	% Goal:
{12}{1000}{6}{500}{-5}{0}{7}{11} = [A]+[B]..      

	% Program:
{X}{Y}A = [{X}B]+[{Y}C] :- A = [B]+[C]..	
{X}{Y} = [{X}]+[{Y}]..
{X} = [{X}]+[ ]..
