	% Inversion of a list of words (separated by "/"). Compare this program to program 
	% REVERSE1.SAM for word inversion. The only essential differences are two symbols 
	% / in the recursive rule, but the performance is different.

	% Goal:
reverse of the list [a b c , d e f , g h l c , d] is [X]..

	% Program:
reverse of the list [A , M] is [N , A] :- reverse of the list [M] is [N]..
reverse of the list [A] is [A]..
