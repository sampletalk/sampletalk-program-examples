	% Merging sorted lists. See also programs LISTDIV.SAM and SORTMERG.SAM.

	% Goal (variable W stands for the merged list):
[{2}{7}{14}{19}{22}{100} ] + [{7}{9}{33} ] = W..

	% Program (sample {K<L} executes Prolog comparison of the numbers):
[{K}A] + [{L}B] = {K}W :- {K<L} ,, [A] + [{L}B] = W..	
[{K}A] + [{L}B] = W :- {K=L} ,, l[A] + [{L}B] = W..
[{K}A] + [{L}B] = {L}W :- [{K}A] + [B] = W..
[ ] + [A ] = A ..
[A ] + [ ] = A ..

	% Notation [list] = [list] + [list] is introduced just here.
	% There is not any special semantics for "+" and "=": these are ordinary SAMPLE characters.
	% In SORTMERGE.SAM we use more expressive notation of these clauses.
