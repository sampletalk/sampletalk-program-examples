	% Word inversion. This program is similar to program REVERSE1.SAM, but has more short syntax.
	% Probably this is the shortest possible representation of the word inversion algorithm
	% for universal programming languages.

	% Goal:
[a b c d e f g h 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9] -> [X]..

	% Program:
[A M] -> [N A] :- [M] -> [N]..
[A] -> [A]..
