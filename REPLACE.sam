	% Change of Variables in an Expression. The goal for this program have the form 
	% [word2|word1](source expression)]=[resulting expression].
	% The program replaces all occurrences of word1 in the source expression by word2. 
	% See application of these clauses in files LOGICTR1.SAM, LOGICTR2.SAM, 
	% LOGICTR3.SAM.

	% Goal (variable W stands for the resulting expression):
[ y*2 | x7 ] ( sin ( 2 * x7 ) + cos ( 4 * x7 ) )  = [ W ] .. 

	% Program:
[ Y | X ] A X M = [ A Y N ] :- [ Y | X ] M = [ N ] ..
[ Y | X ] A = [ A ] ..
