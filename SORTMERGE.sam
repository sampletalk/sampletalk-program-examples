	% Sorting a list of numbers by dividing the list into two parts, sorting these parts, 
	% and then merging the results. See also programs LISTDIV.SAM - dividing a list, 
	% MERGE.SAM - merging lists.

	% Goal (variable W stands for the sorted list):
sort of the list {7}{7}{7}{128}{2}{12}{10}{-130}{1993}{1492}{5743}* is list W..

	% Program. Boundary conditions for 2-element and 1-element lists:
sort of the list {M}{N}* is list {M}{N}* :- {M<N} ..
sort of the list {M}{N}* is list {N}{M}* ..
sort of the list {M}* is list {M}* ..

	% Recursive rule:
sort of the list A is list W :- 
	list A consists of even elemens [E] and odd elements [O] ,,
	sort of the list E is list X ,,
	sort of the list O is list Y ,,
	result of merging lists [X] and [Y] is list W ..

	% Clauses for dividing a list into two parts - for even and odd elements - recursive rule:
list {X}{Y}A consists of even elemens [{X}B] and odd elements [{Y}C] :- 
	list A  consists of even elemens [B] and odd elements [C] ..	

	% Boundary conditions for 1-element and 0-element lists:
list {X}* consists of even elemens [{X}*] and odd elements [*] .. 
list * consists of even elemens [*] and odd elements [*] ..

	% Clauses for merging sorted lists - recursive rules:
result of merging lists [{K}A] and [{L}B] is list {K}W :- {K<L} ,, result of merging lists [A] and [{L}B] is list W ..
result of merging lists [{K}A] and [{L}B] is list W :- {K = L} ,, result of merging lists [A] and [{L}B] is list W ..
result of merging lists [{K}A] and [{L}B] is list {L}W :- result of merging lists [{K}A] and [B] is list W ..

	% Boundary conditions for 0-element and 1-element lists:
result of merging lists [*] and [A*] is list A* ..
result of merging lists [A*] and [*] is list A* ..
