	% Morphologic analysis of English word forms.
	% This program produces morphologic analyses for regular English word forms (represented in the 
	% dictionary below) and demonstrates possibility of creating applications "from scratch" rather than 
	% represents a completed morphologic analyzer. One of the ways to develop this program consists in 
	% forming a good dictionary. In the same way, we can add semantic information like "entity", 
	% "living being", superlative-comparative adjectives, etc.
	% This is real extraction of an algorithm from field data. I took the word "queried", 
	% generalized it into "Wied", then made "Wy" from "query", and got the 1-st clause.
	% All the rest was made in the same way. No arrays, no formal grammars, no loops.
	% Use compiler option for finding all decisions for the current goal.


	% Goals (variable X stands for the result of the analysis). Leave uncommented exactly one of them:
morphology of word [b a c k] is X..       
%morphology of word [b a c k e d] is X..       
%morphology of word [b a k e d] is X..       
%morphology of word [q u e r i e d] is X..
%morphology of word [q u e r i e s] is X..
